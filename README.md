# Profile

Hello, everyone! My name is Nelson Guevara and I am a second year MURP student. My area of concentration is Desing and Development, and so a long term career goal of mine is to promote social justice from the lens of the built environment. Specifically, I wish to promote desing practices that support sustainability, commmunity health, and community engagement in the desing process. I beleive that the physcial environemnt better serves underrepresented communities when people are involved in the process of deciding not only what a new building should look like, but also what its purpoe will be in the community. I have some expereience in both the private and public sector. I got the opportunity to work alongside an economic developemnt team in the City of Huntington Beach and assist in business retenetion, growth, and expansion. In the private sector I was a right of way agent for Del Richardson and Assocaites. I worked on real estate acquisition projects for developers and government aagencies such as METRO. I hope that my time here at UCLA helps me contextualize my past experiences from an Urban Planning perspective and helps me **_be a better urban planner_** in the near future.

In my free time I am most likely talking about sports, reading about sports, or watching sports. Feel free to talk to me about your team! 

### Objectives for the Course

- Develop the coding skills necessary to provide detailed and efficient visual data.
- Be able to interpret visual data and contextualize it for audiences to understand.
- Be critical of data and understand the various frameworks that data is presented in.
- Have a fundamental understadning of what are the best practices for presenting spatial data.

### Project Ideas

I have a few preliminary project ideas that vary in urban planning topics:

1. Using GIS to highlight socioeconomic status of recent vast redevelopment areas (such as Inglewood) and what that means for underrepresented communities.
2. Meauring connectivity throughout various communities in Southern California:
  - highlight communities that have better access and better means of transportation
  - using GIS data to develop a framework of Southern California's transportation infrastructure in different communities (complete streets, train lines, bus lines, freeways, etc.)
3. Assess the impact of urban development on the environment using GIS maps and data.
