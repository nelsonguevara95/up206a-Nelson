# Potential Datasets

### Inglewood Census Data: Income 

- *Description*: One of my potential project interest is in looking at the recent developments in Inglewood and the impacts it potenatially has on the citizens of Inglewood. One of the ways to track some of the changes in to gather data in income and following the trend to determine what kind of change there has been over the years. I downloaded census income data for Inglewood for the year 2010 and 2019.

### Inglewood Census Data: Demographics

- *Description*: Another factor in reseasrching the impacts of new development in Inglewood is looking at demographic changes. New development itself does not neccessarily cause changes in demographics, but the effects of new development certainly seem to hurt minority communities. I have picked out demographic census data for the City of Inglewood for the years 2010 and 2019.

### Home Value Trends: Zillow's Home Value Index

- *Description*: This potential project also peaked my interest in looking at the market value trends of houses during a certain time period. The site of interest is Inglewood, and the data contains information for Inglewood, but I am also interested in comparing Inglewood to other Californian cities to compare different home vlaues and rate of growth over a period of time.
